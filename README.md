# Chat-is-this-real-
Learning CustomTkinter for GUI and how to network with Python
I want to learn a proper GUI library instead of using just PYGame and using networking to make a chat program as the basis of what I wanted to do.

# Initial requirements - 
 - Top bar
   - Change name of user
   - Allow user to connect with single other chat
 - Chat box
   - Users can type text to send messages
   - Messages box will update with any message sent
   - Message will have timestamp and name of sender
